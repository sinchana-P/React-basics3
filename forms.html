 <!-- Controlled Components:

    In HTML, form elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select> 
    typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. 
    In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState(). 

    An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

    Since the value attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value will always be this.state.value, making the React state the source of truth. 
    Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.
